### **V.1.0.1 (beta)**

This is the release who adds the module command. The module command doesn't have a lot of securities the next update will be about this fact. Also the modules doesn't actually 100% working. Only the install argument work and the other arguments don't work.

Things to correct:

- Only the install argument working
- The module install command don't install the module
- The beta programm is not there it's coming soon
- The update command is coming soon
