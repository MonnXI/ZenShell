# ZenShell Project
ZenShell is a project of bash with custom commands and modules that you can install to do things like: brutforce a password, check a json file, get a wifi list, etc.

#### This programm is suppose to be stable. But not now because we just created the beta branch so now the beta and the main are the same but when the 1.0.1 will release officialy it will not be the same.
