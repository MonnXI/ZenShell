│v1.1.10 (beta)
│
│SMALL REMEMBER :
│
│A module is just an elif with the variable name= to set the name of the module in it and also uses │the arg1, arg2, arg3 and arg4 for arguments (up to 4 arguments).
│Also the end there is this line of code: read -p "┌[ZenShell] > " commandvar arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4.
│This update also removes the sudo command and add a beta variable to get the beta versions of │ZenShell.
│
│IMPORTANT --- The objective of modules is to get the community to participate while creating any │modules they want with their need
│
│
│What's new :
└  -The update command is there with a way to download the beta version and the stable with only one command
