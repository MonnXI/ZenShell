This is a version who adds the modules command a module is a custom command with capabilities and can be linked to python files. A module is just an elif with the variable name= to set the name of the module in it and also uses the arg1, arg2, arg3 and arg4 for arguments (up to 4 arguments) and at the end there is this line of code: read -p "â”Œ[ZenShell] > " commandvar arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4. This update also removes the sudo command and add a beta variable to get the beta versions of ZenShell.
