v1.1.1 stable

REMINDER :

A module is just an elif with the variable name= to set the name of the module in it and also uses the arg1, arg2, arg3 and arg4 for arguments (up to 4 arguments).
Also the end there is this line of code: read -p "â”Œ[ZenShell] > " commandvar arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4.
This update also removes the sudo command and add a beta variable to get the beta versions of ZenShell.

IMPORTANT --- The objective of modules is to get the community to participate while creating any modules they want with their need

WHAT'S NEW :
-The update command is there to update your script or switch from stable to beta.
